# postfixadmin uses the function password_hash with PASSWORD_DEFAULT since version 3.3.0.
# password_hash() creates a new password hash using a strong one-way hashing algorithm.
# PASSWORD_DEFAULT - Use the bcrypt algorithm (default as of PHP 5.5.0). Note that this constant is designed to change over time as new and stronger algorithms are added to PHP.
# PASSWORD_BCRYPT - Use the CRYPT_BLOWFISH algorithm to create the hash. This will produce a standard crypt() compatible hash using the "$2y$" identifier. The result will always be a 60 character string, or false on failure.
# See also: https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.password-hash.php
